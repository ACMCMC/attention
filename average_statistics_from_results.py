# # Average statistics from results
#
# This notebook gets the average results from the experiments, which should be stored under the folder `results/{language}/{configuration}/{model_name}`.
# Each of these folders contains the following subfolders:
# - `figures`: contains the figures generated by the experiments (PDF)
# - `number_of_heads_matching`: a set of CSVs named `heads_matching_{DEPENDENCY_TYPE}.csv` with the number of times that a head attention's has correctly matched the dependency type. (rows are layers, columns are heads)
# - `variability`: a set of CSVs named `variability_{DEPENDENCY_TYPE}.csv` with the variability score for each layer and head.
# - `uas_scores`: a set of CSVs named `uas_{DEPENDENCY_TYPE}.csv` with the UAS score for each layer and head.
